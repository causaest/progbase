## Recommended Packages (15)

boot: Bootstrap Functions (Originally by Angelo Canty for S)
Functions and datasets for bootstrapping from the book "Bootstrap Methods and Their Application" by A. C. Davison and D. V. Hinkley (1997, CUP), originally written by Angelo Canty for S.

class: Functions for Classification
Various functions for classification, including k-nearest neighbour, Learning Vector Quantization and Self-Organizing Maps.

cluster: "Finding Groups in Data": Cluster Analysis Extended Rousseeuw et al.
Methods for Cluster analysis. Much extended the original from Peter Rousseeuw, Anja Struyf and Mia Hubert, based on Kaufman and Rousseeuw (1990) "Finding Groups in Data".

codetools: Code Analysis Tools for R
Code analysis tools for R.

foreign: Read Data Stored by 'Minitab', 'S', 'SAS', 'SPSS', 'Stata', 'Systat', 'Weka', 'dBase', ...
Reading and writing data stored by some versions of 'Epi Info', 'Minitab', 'S', 'SAS', 'SPSS', 'Stata', 'Systat', 'Weka', and for reading and writing some 'dBase' files.

KernSmooth: Functions for Kernel Smoothing Supporting Wand & Jones (1995)
Functions for kernel smoothing (and density estimation) corresponding to the book: Wand, M.P. and Jones, M.C. (1995) "Kernel Smoothing".

lattice: Trellis Graphics for R
A powerful and elegant high-level data visualization system inspired by Trellis graphics, with an emphasis on multivariate data. Lattice is sufficient for typical graphics needs, and is also flexible enough to handle most nonstandard requirements. See ?Lattice for an introduction.

MASS: Support Functions and Datasets for Venables and Ripley's MASS
Functions and datasets to support Venables and Ripley, "Modern Applied Statistics with S" (4th edition, 2002).

Matrix: Sparse and Dense Matrix Classes and Methods
A rich hierarchy of matrix classes, including triangular, symmetric, and diagonal matrices, both dense and sparse and with pattern, logical and numeric entries. Numerous methods for and operations on these matrices, using 'LAPACK' and 'SuiteSparse' libraries.

mgcv: Mixed GAM Computation Vehicle with Automatic Smoothness Estimation
Generalized additive (mixed) models, some of their extensions and other generalized ridge regression with multiple smoothing parameter estimation by (Restricted) Marginal Likelihood, Generalized Cross Validation and similar, or using iterated nested Laplace approximation for fully Bayesian inference. See Wood (2017) <doi:10.1201/9781315370279> for an overview. Includes a gam() function, a wide variety of smoothers, 'JAGS' support and distributions beyond the exponential family.

nlme: Linear and Nonlinear Mixed Effects Models
Fit and compare Gaussian linear and nonlinear mixed-effects models.

nnet: Feed-Forward Neural Networks and Multinomial Log-Linear Models
Software for feed-forward neural networks with a single hidden layer, and for multinomial log-linear models.

rpart: Recursive Partitioning and Regression Trees
Recursive partitioning for classification, regression and survival trees. An implementation of most of the functionality of the 1984 book by Breiman, Friedman, Olshen and Stone.

spatial: Functions for Kriging and Point Pattern Analysis
Functions for kriging and point pattern analysis.

survival: Survival Analysis
Contains the core survival analysis routines, including definition of Surv objects, Kaplan-Meier and Aalen-Johansen (multi-state) curves, Cox models, and parametric accelerated failure time models.
